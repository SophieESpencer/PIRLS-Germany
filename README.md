In this investigation I am using the data from the 2021 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) assessment in Germany to understand the learning experiences and performance of Arabic-speaking refugee children in Germany, in comparison with their peers. For each country there is a dataset for:

School Context - A questionnaire answered by headteachers

Home Context - A questionnaire answered by parents

School Context - A questionnaire answered by pupils

as well as the data from the assessments themselves. 

These three datasets mentioned above, allow me to identify children that were not born in Germany, who speak Arabic at home, who have arrived in Germany recently. It cannot be assumed that all such children are refugees and asylum-seekers, who would exhibit different learning needs to other Arabic-speaking immigrant children, however, with the high number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees present in Germany, it can be assumed that a high number of this group, also fall within this category.
